# [Neversitup] Testing in Frontend Developer (React.js) Position

I have used the React to do this test and I have used the cypress.io to test the component.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run cypress:open`

Launches the cypress test runner in the interactive watch mode.
